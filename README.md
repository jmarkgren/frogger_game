The goal of the game is to move the player accross the board and reach the water without colliding with any of the enemy bugs.

To play the game, use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move your player accross the board. Avoid the enemy bugs! If your player collides with any of the enemies, the player moves back to the starting position. To win the game, the player must reach the water.
